These directories represent the implementation of the Bachelor thesis
"Post-Quantum Cryptography in Zcash: Security Analysis and Migration Strategies" by Hannes Hacker.

- "thesis_prototype_secuer_git_ceremony" holds the contents of Git repositories utilized for the distributed SECUER generation protocol
- "thesis_prototypes_digital_signatures" holds the source code for the prototypes, benchmarks and contributions associated with the utilized digital signatures

We provided a "README.md" in both directories to give an overview over content, setup and usage of them.
Other "README.md" are included, e.g. in the SECUER protocol tools, because we utilized already existing repositories.
